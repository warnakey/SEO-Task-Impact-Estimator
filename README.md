SEO Task Impact Estimator
-----------------

This is a fun tool that allows you to see what the impact of performing SEO tasks on a website might be. This can be used to help you prioritize your SEO plans, or for general educational purposes.

+ Made it so text inputs can accept text regardless of how they are capitalized
+ Adjusted a few values between lines 82 and 108

Version 1.0 published on August 15, 2018 at 11pm
+ Created a tool that asks for last year's traffic of a website, the traffic of the most important keyword the site wants to rank for and a few other things before allowing you to choose from a list of SEO tasks that are commonly performed before finally spitting out an estimate of how many new visitors that task will bring to your website.
+ This is outrageously inaccurate and should NEVER be used for any purpose other than guessing.
